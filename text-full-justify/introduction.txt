text-full-justify

Given a text with max_width, format the text such that each line has exactly max_width characters and is fully (left and right) justified. 
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified.

For example:

"This is an example of text justification.".full_justify(16)
# => "This    is    an\nexample  of text\njustification.  "

"What must be acknowledgment shall be".full_justify(16)
# => "What   must   be\nacknowledgment  \nshall be        "

"Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do".full_justify(20)
# =>   "Science  is  what we\nunderstand      well\nenough to explain to\na  computer.  Art is\neverything  else  we\ndo                  "
