search-and-replace
Replacing Multiple Patterns in a Single Pass - Ruby Cookbook

You want to perform multiple, simultaneous search-and-replace operations on a string.

For example:

"GO HOME!".mgsub([[/.*GO/i, 'Home'], [/home/i, 'is where the heart is']])
# => "Home is where the heart is!"

"Here is number #123".mgsub([[/[a-z]/i, '#'], [/#/, 'P']])
# => "#### ## ###### P123"
