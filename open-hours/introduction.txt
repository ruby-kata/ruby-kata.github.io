Amy and Valerie, the shop owners, need you to develop a simple program that satisfies the following requirements:

    The opening days and hours of the shop need to be configurable, and can be scattered in the week (e.g. Mon, Wed, Fri from 08:00 to 16:00)
    Amy needs to display the date of the next opening on a billboard outside of the shop
    Amy also wants to display on the website of the shop whether it is opened or closed at the moment

Write a small module that follows this contract, so that Valerie can easily integrate it:

OpeningHours.isOpenOn(date)
OpeningHours.nextOpeningDate(date)

For example:

    Shop opening days: Mon, Wed, Fri
    Shop opening hours: 08:00 - 16:00

    wednesday = '2016-05-11T12:22:11.824Z'
    thursday = '2016-05-12T12:22:11.824Z'
    fridayMorning = '2016-05-13T08:00:00.000Z'

    OpeningHours.isOpenOn(wednesday) == true
    OpeningHours.isOpenOn(thursday) == false

    OpeningHours.nextOpeningDate(wednesday) === fridayMorning
