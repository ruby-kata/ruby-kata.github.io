Statistics is a field of mathematics that pertains to data analysis. Statistical methods and equations can be applied to a data set in order to analyze and interpret results, explain variations in the data, or predict future data. 

A few examples of statistical information we can calculate are:

  + Average value (mean)
  + Most frequently occurring value (mode)
  + On average, how much each measurement deviates from the mean (standard deviation of the mean)
  + Span of values over which your data set occurs (range), and
  + Midpoint between the lowest and highest value of the set (median)

For example:

 the mean of [1,2,2,3,5] is 2.6
 the median of [1,2,2,3,5] is 2
 the standard_deviation of [1,2,2,3,5] is 1.52
 the only mode of [1,1,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4] is 4 
 modes of [1,1,2,2,3,4,4] are [1,2,4] 
 there is no modes in [1,2,3]
