Ruby Cookbook

You have a number of linear equations (that is, equations that look like “2x + 10y+ 8z = 54”), 
and you want to figure out the solution: the values of x, y, and z. 

For example:

    solve_linear_equations([
        "2x + 10y + 8z = 54",
        "7y + 4z = 30",
        "5x + 5y + 5z = 35"
    ])
    # => {x: 1, y: 2, z: 4}
