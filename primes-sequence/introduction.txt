primes-sequence

You want to generate a sequence of prime numbers

primes_sequence = PrimesSequence.new
primes_sequence.succ # => 2
primes_sequence.succ # => 3
primes_sequence.succ # => 5
primes_sequence.succ # => 7

PrimesSequence[0..3] # [2,3,5,7]
PrimesSequence[..4]  # [2,3,5,7,11]
PrimesSequence[6]    # => 17
