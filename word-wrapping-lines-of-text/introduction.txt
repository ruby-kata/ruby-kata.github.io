Word-Wrapping Lines of Text - Ruby Cookbook

You want to turn a string full of miscellaneous whitespace into a string formatted
with linebreaks at appropriate intervals, so that the text can be displayed in a win-
dow or sent as an email.

For example:

puts wrap("This text is not too short to be wrapped.", 20)
# This text is not too
# short to be wrapped.

puts wrap("These ten-character columns are stifling my creativity!", 10)
# These
# ten-character
# columns
# are
# stifling
# my
# creativity!
